# LibraryManagementSystem-ReactJS
This is my self-made React app which can be used to create and maintain library data including books, issues and returns.

To run this project on your pc, clone this repo and install the packages using- npm install
Host 2 JSON databases using the command -  npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000 and  npx json-server --watch data/issue.json --port 1000
Then install react router dom by the command - npm install react-router-dom@{version} -> my setup= npm install react-router-dom@5

Then run the app using npm run start
